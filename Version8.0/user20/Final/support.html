                        Technically, there is no "right" time to book a flight, but there are certain guidelines you can
                        follow to ensure you are getting a good price. Christopher Elliott , journalist, consumer advice
                        advocate and creator of Elliott.org, recommended travelers purchase their flight tickets at
                        least 14 or more days (two to three weeks) in advance for both domestic and international
                        flights. And if you can, never buy a flight within 24 hours of departure. "Airlines jack up the
                        rates within 24 hours and for walk-ups," Elliott said. He also strongly warned against buying a
                        flight too early because airlines price flights at their highest when first released about 300
                        to 320 days in advance. George Hobica, the creator of Airfarewatchdog, advised travelers to "set
                        up free airfare alerts by email and pounce when there's an unadvertised sale, which could happen
                        at any moment, with huge savings."

                        Earlier than when you'd book your flight. The American Hotel & Lodging Association officials
                        recommended booking accommodations as soon as you have your dates finalized, especially if you
                        are traveling with a family or have special requests, such as ADA compliant rooms, cribs, etc.
                        The association also suggested booking directly with the hotel as it typically offers the best
                        rates. Plus, you'll be much more likely to earn loyalty program points if you choose not to book
                        through a third-party site like Expedia or Orbitz. Dave Solomito, director of brand marketing at
                        Kayak, agreed that travelers should make hotel reservations as soon as possible if they have
                        specific dates, but added that those with flexibility may find greater deals booking last
                        minute. "If you wait until the day you arrive in your destination, you may find a great
                        last-minute deal as hotels look to sure up their occupancy each night," he said. Hotel Tonight,
                        Travelzoo and Last Minute Travel are great resources to consult if you're looking to plan a
                        vacation on a whim.

                        If your flight is canceled, immediately go to the ticket counter to determine your options. And
                        while you're in line, Hobica recommended calling the airline to see if a customer service
                        representative can assist you over the phone (he or she may be able to help you before you reach
                        the front of the line). Hobica also suggested travelers reach out to the airline via Twitter to
                        see if the customer service agent manning the airline's social media account can be of
                        assistance. "American Airlines' Twitter staff is especially responsive in this regard," Hobica
                        said.

                        This question is widely debated and disputed among travel experts and writers alike. All of our
                        sources agreed that there is no such thing as a "best" day for booking travel plans. In fact,
                        Elliott and Solomito noted that recent data has proven that the "best day" theory is a gimmick.
                        And although prices do vary during different times of the week, Solomito noted that the average
                        savings are usually only $5 to $15. "There is absolutely no magic day. That's a myth," Hobica
                        said. "You buy when you're ready to fly. Don't play the game," Elliott added.

                        Before obtaining a visa, travelers should first determine whether or not the country they're
                        traveling to requires one. For instance, some countries like Russia and Australia require you to
                        have a visa regardless of the duration of your stay, even if you'll be in the country for just
                        two days. Luckily, many countries only require a visa for longer stays, usually those exceeding
                        90 days. The U.S. Department of State is a great resource for American citizens looking to
                        travel abroad and provides a wealth of knowledge and country-specific details, including entry
                        and exit requirements, visa information and travel alerts and warnings.

                        If you do need a visa, call or make an appointment with the country's consulate. The consulate
                        will provide you with the next steps for obtaining a visa, and tell you whether or not you can
                        send the visa paperwork via mail or if you must apply in person. Keep in mind that visa costs
                        and fees vary from country to country. Also, note that some countries have multiple consulates
                        and cater to geographical areas, so make sure you are in contact with the specific consulate
                        assigned to your region.

                    There is no definitive rule of thumb to help you determine whether or not travel insurance is
                    necessary. However, Elliott recommended investing in travel insurance if it's a trip that costs more
                    than $5,000 or a "vacation that you can't afford to lose." And Solomito agreed: "Travel insurance is
                    always a good idea if you can swing it, especially when you are planning a big trip and have
                    invested significantly into your travel plans," he said. Other factors, such as specific health
                    restrictions, should also be considered. For instance, if you have a health condition that may cause
                    you to cancel your travel plans, health insurance is probably a smart investment. But most
                    importantly, if travel insurance will ease your travel anxieties, it's worth it. "If you're going
                    somewhere and it'll give you peace of mind, buy it," Elliott said.

                    If your bags don't come off the conveyor belt, alert airline personnel immediately. Each airline
                    usually has a service kiosk located in the baggage claim area where someone will be able to assist
                    you in tracking down your bags and filing a report.

                    Fortunately, the U.S. Department of Transportation has started to crack down on airlines that are
                    not providing necessary support to travelers with delayed or lost luggage. Specifically, it has
                    enhanced the protection and compensation that airlines must provide to travelers. Factors such as
                    whether or not you're away from home and how long it will take to track down your bag contribute to
                    how much compensation the airline is required to provide. If you have to buy any necessities due to
                    your delayed baggage, make sure to save all your receipts so the airline can properly reimburse you.
                    In rare cases, the airline may give you a cash advance.

                    If you purchased your flight with a credit card, Hobica recommended checking with your credit card
                    company to see if it covers lost or delayed baggage. "If you paid for the flight with certain credit
                    cards, the issuer may have automatic, free insurance to help out in bag delay situations," he said.
